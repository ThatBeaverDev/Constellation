If you need to build on top of it to correct\n   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at\n   the tip of the \"master\".  This is not strictly necessary, but\n   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.\n\n * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic\n   branches, merge them into \"next\" branch.\n\nThe script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name\nto be \"next\", but it is trivial to make it configurable via\n$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.\n\nWith this workflow, you would want to know:\n\n(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to \"next\".  Young\n    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather\n    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been\n    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without\n    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would\n    not want to rewind it.\n\n(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to \"master\".\n    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not\n    build on top of it -- other people may already want to\n    change things related to the topic as patches against your\n    \"master\", so if you need further changes, it is better to\n    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the\n    tip of \"master\".\n\nLet's look at this example:\n\n\t\t   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"next\"\n\t\t  /       /           /           /\n\t\t /   a---a---b A     /           /\n\t\t/   /               /           /\n\t       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /\n\t      /   /   /             \\         /\n\t     /   /   /   b---b C     \\       /\n\t    /   /   /   /             \\     /\n    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"master\"\n\n\nA, B and C are topic branches.\n\n * A has one fix since it was merged up to \"next\".\n\n * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to \"master\" and \"next\",\n   and is ready to be deleted.\n\n * C has not merged to \"next\" at all.\n\nWe would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage\nB to be deleted.\n\nTo compute (1):\n\n\tgit rev-list ^master ^topic next\n\tgit rev-list ^master        next\n\n\tif these match, topic has not merged in next at all.\n\nTo compute (2):\n\n\tgit rev-list master..topic\n\n\tif this is empty, it is fully merged to \"master\".\n\nDOC_END\n",
