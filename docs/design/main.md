# Constellation Design Guidelines

##### For Constellation Sahara

Constellation's design principals follow the design for a keyboard-first OS.

# Colours

Apps should utilise the heirarchy system of colours and the accent colour to
make the layering clear.

For Example:

1. The Window Body is Primary (layer 1)
2. The sidebar background is Secondary (layer 2)
3. The button background is Tertiary (layer 3)
4. The icon background on the button is Quaternary (layer 4)
5. The text is the Quinary layer, although since it is text this is simply the
   text color.

In terms of accent colour, the OS accent colour provided should be used, NOT the
app's own colour, though accent colours in relation to content are allowed.
